CSS Peek
This really helpful extension by Pranay Prakash helps us when working with markup language class strings and IDs 
by identifying and enumerating the different styles already applied to the said element. This is very helpful 
as it saves us a lot of time going back and forth html and css files and also comes in handy for developers
that do not enjoy having split screens.
